# Practicing RoR

# ladder
probably good idea for us to share code and think about how we split this up/what is practical and possible for each of us to do.

## IMPORTANT
### If you are going to play around with the HTML (most of which will be in app/views/layouts) then save your work *in your own branch!*  We can always merge it *later*.

## Contents
### lander
  - has all the landing page bits and pieces

### ladder_ror
