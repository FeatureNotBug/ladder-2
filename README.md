probably good idea for us to share code and think about how we split this up/what is practical and possible for each of us to do.

IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THE PAGES LOOK
I don't know another way other than
- install rails and ruby (with RVM is good, just look it up and follow the steps)
- clone this directory
- go to terminal and enter "rails server"
- go on browser to "localhost:3000"
- play around!

Current pages include:
- localhost:3000/campaigns/structure
- localhost:3000/campaigns/performance
- localhost:3000/campaigns
