# ladder
probably good idea for us to share code and think about how we split this up/what is practical and possible for each of us to do.

## IMPORTANT
### If you are going to play around with the HTML (most of which will be in app/views/layouts) then save your work *in your own branch!*  We can always merge it *later*.

## If you want to see how the pages look:
I don't know another way (currently) other than
- install rails and ruby (with RVM is good, just look it up and follow the steps)
- clone this directory
- go to terminal and enter "rails server"
- go on browser to "localhost:3000"
- play around!

  - has all the landing page bits and pieces

### ladder_ror
