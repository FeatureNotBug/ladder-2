# Database Work

- Add + Select Audience buttons

- add Message object
  - each Message knows which Campaign it is associated with
- Add Message + Select Message buttons

- add Creative object (is that an image file?)
  - each Creative knows which Campaign it is associated with
- Add Creative + Select Creative buttons

# Next on Todo

- Everything is sent to the client for approval
  - at this rate, will probably do by sending link to platform (?)

## API related

- Put Campaign live (ELSEWHERE, an indicator shows "live")
  - therefore, need Campaign to have property "status"
- Make the report out of the stats

## Other (ought to have them, but may not get to -??!)

- display Campaign name after "VIEWING" in layout view
- allow one user to have multiple Campaigns (probably represented by ids...cannot find other way to declare in database)
- add corresponding menu to allow user to switch between Campaigns to view
- add a add Campaign button ?
