== Database Work

- add Audience object
  - Each Campaign will have an array of Audiences (probably represented by ids unless I can find way to declare directly)
  - Possibly property of Audience is description?
- Add + Select Audience buttons

- add Message object
  - Each Campaign will have an array of Messages (see above parens)
  - Message is text format?
- Add Message + Select Message buttons

- add Creative object (is that an image file?)
  - Each Campaign will have an array of Creatives (see above parens)
- Add Creative + Select Creative buttons

== Next on Todo

- Everything is sent to the client for approval
  - at this rate, will probably do by sending link to platform (?)

= API related

- Put Campaign live (ELSEWHERE, an indicator shows "live")
- Make the report out of the stats
